# agile_framework

Agile Based Framework. Work was done during IU Summer Internship 2020 using [VueJS](https://vuejs.org/), [Vue Router](https://router.vuejs.org/), [Vue Bootstrap](https://bootstrap-vue.org/), [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/) and [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/). This framework combines best elements from various Agile frameworks to derive another approach to Agile methodologies.

## Build Setup

``` bash
# install dependencies
npm install

npm run dev

# build for production with minification
# the resulting build is located in docs/ directory
npm run build

# build for production and view the bundle analyzer report
npm run build --report
```
